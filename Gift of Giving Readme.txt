Hello Andrew,

Thanks for teaching this class this semester. I really enjoyed it.

The instructions for gift of giving are:

The login.php file is the login/home page. From there you can click the sign up link to create an account. Once you sign up, you can login and access any page.

I have included prepopulated user and family data in the datadump20210214 file. 

Lastly, the $connection string is located in the sharedfunctions.php file if you need to update it.

Thanks again,
Daniel Shea
